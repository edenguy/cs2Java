* Model 

Auto generated JAVA code from the YAMLParser output. 
This is the final java artifact, which represents the C# data model. 
This project contains a couple of custom date serializers.
Once YAMLParser runs, it will get populated with the auto generated model in Model/src/main/java/Model/Autogenerated/
