# YAMLParser 

After running the Reflector2YAML c# project, we have a YAML representation of our cs schema.
cs2Java/YAMLParser/dataModel.yaml 

YAMLParser reads this dataModel.yaml file and parses it for classes and data members.
The parser is Java code (Mevin based) which spits out java code corresponding to the C# reflected tyeps in the YAML.

INPUT: cs2Java/YAMLParser/dataModel.yaml OUTPUT: Model/src/main/java/Model/Autogenerated/
